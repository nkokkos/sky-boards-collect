How to generate AR1000 or DS1000 Contiki OS collect-view firmware:

1. Rename 

"collect-view-sky-AR1000.c" or 
"collect-view-sky-DS1000.c" to 
"collect-view-sky.c"

$ mv collect-view-sky.c collect-view-sky-bk.c
$ mv collect-view-sky-AR1000.c collect-view-sky.c

2. Compile any program that includes "contiki-collect.h", like

+ examples/sky-shell/sky-shell.c
+ examples/ipv6/rpl-collect/udp-sender.c
+ examples/collect/collect-view-shell.c

3. After compilation is complete, firmware file should be found
in the same directory, with name "tmpimage.ihex"
Rename and make executable

$ mv tmpimage.ihex myFirmware.ihex
$ chmod ugo+x myFirmware.ihex

NOTE that this is also valid for others platforms. Just write your own 
collect-view-template.c and edit Makefile.collect-view as needed.
