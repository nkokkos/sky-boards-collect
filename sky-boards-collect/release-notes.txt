==Release 1.6 b==

 * New UI makes much more easy to feed entire network sensor data from your network to cosm and/or open.sen.se. Also it has good resize behavior (unlike 1.5b cosm/sense UI).

 * Conversions tool has been improved quite a lot as well. Chart is resized along with the application's window. The slider controls the crosshair. The marker labelled "Last received" indicates the x possition of the last received ADC/raw value for the sensor. The label on top ( f(x)=y) shows the current crosshair possition, which also can be set with a click on the line that represents the function.

==Release 1.5 b==

So far this extension application have been developed and tested using only three (real) motes. That number of nodes is not nearly enough to ensure everything is working ok. I have been running the program taking the input data from a Cooja simulated network with 25 nodes, which is a proper test environment. As a consequence, this release fixes new found bugs.

 * Fixed a bug introduced with new node classes (AR1000, DS1000, ...) related to the way the nodes were created in {{{HandleLinks}}} method

 * Fixed a bug that was affecting usability on Cosm/Sense config dialog

 * Code refactoring

 * Tiny log in Cosm/Sense panel that shows HTTP response for last data push.

 * Changes in {{{TimeChartPanel.java}}} in order to adapt class to show time series in platform-heterogeneous networks, when different node types are selected.
 
 * Implementation of items grouping algorithm  ({{{updateSeries()}}} in {{{TimeChartPanel.java}}}). 

 * CO conversion expression had a default wrong constant value ({{{R0}}}) which now should be ok, according to data sheet.

 * Drivers {{{install.sh}}} files updated to contiki2.6 version


==Release 1.4 b==

 * This release fixes a bug (introduced in version 1.0b, not happening in contiki-collect-sky2.5) that caused charts to display zero values when they should not display anything

 * Added option in Adjust conversion expressions tool to show either ADC_VALUE or Vs in X-axis.

 * Code quality improvements. 


==Release 1.3 b==

 * Fixed a problem with decimal: if Java locale is set to a country that uses "," as decimal mark, Cosm/Sense will treat decimal values as NaN (Not a Number). Program replaces now "," for "." before sending values.

==Release 1.2 b==

 * Updated Cosm Feeder due to Cosm API changes
 * Application will set now "Contiki collect-view" as User-Agent instead of using default "Java/1.xx"
 * Added title in "view conversions expressions" frame

==Release 1.1 b==

 * "Adjust conversion expressions" tool gui improved
 * Generated new firmware with better solution for issue 1

==Release 1.0 b==

 * First release
